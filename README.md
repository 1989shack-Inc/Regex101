Important notice
=======
I am currently in the process of updating the website, if you have any suggestions and want to help, send me an email at `contact@regex101.com` and I will send you an invitation to the slack channel.

About
=======
My name is Firas Dib, a developer from Sweden in my mid 20s finishing my final exams to take my masters in computer engineering. Regex101 has been my hobby project for a couple of years now and I've seen it go from unknown to one of the largest regex testing services on the web. This makes me very happy and is my motivation to continue working on it and making it even better.

I will continue to host website for the forseeable future, and maintain it for as much as I can. I have been considering making it open source, so you don't need to ask me or open an issue about it. 

Disclaimers
=======
Anyone, including companies, can use my service freely. What I ask of you is to not redistrubute my code as your own without my permission. The expressions and data you save will be saved in a MySQL database. Your private information used to sign in is _not_ stored on my server. If you have any sensitive information that you don't want to leak out, don't save it as it will end up on my server.

I have no plans of ever clearing the database (unless it grows incredibly large, which it hasn't) which means the expressions you save _should_ last forever.
